# URL shortener
- Kotlin + Spring API REST to make URL shorter
- I've done this project as an exercise to have a simple & public example of what I usually develop in my professional projects
- This was made from my own [kotlin+spring boilerplate repo](https://github.com/marcpascualsanchez/kotlin-spring-boilerplate)

## Run
- Make sure to have the JRE and SDK with corretto-17 or compatible
- I developed the project using a TDD approach and I've not prepared a Redis docker for local yet. I encourage to run it in the e2e tests with an embedded Redis.

## Docs
- Check the OpenAPI with a GET request at `/api-docs`
